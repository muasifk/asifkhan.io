         <h3>  Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar </h3>
         <h4> Dissertaion Title: "Framework for Content Distribution over Wireless LANs" </h4>
            <p> My thesis research aimed at the investigation of the limitations of Wi-Fi networks to cope with
            challenges in future deployments. The research proposes efficient techniques using robust
            optimization algorithms (i.e. integer programming) and machine learning to solve several problems
            in Wi-Fi networks. We proposed: (1) efficient group formation scheme to improve device-to-device
            networking. (2) optimal network clustering scheme using integer programming, (3) UAV-aided
            network architecture to cope with user mobility, (4) highly efficient machine learning model for
            transmission throughput prediction, and (5) novel schemes for handover prediction, and access point
            selection using machine learning in cognitive networking. Various tools are used for implementing
            and evaluating the proposed schemes, i.e., CVXPY, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, mac80211sim, Mininet
            and ns-3. The performance of these schemes are evaluated using extensive simulations to validate
            the results. The research outcomes are published in reputable peer-reviewed journals and
            international conferences.</p>

         <h4> Thesis Title: “MAC-Aware Dynamic Source Routing Protocol” </h4>
         <p>  The research focuses on improving the performance of Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) routing
                protocol in Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANETs) by using cross layer designing. The default routing
                metric (i.e. number of hops between the source and destination) is replaced by a new metric (i.e.
                total MAC delay along the selected route). The proposed scheme benefits from the EDCA’s traffic
                prioriterization using access categories for each traffic types (i.e. background traffic, best effort, voic
                and video). The proposed scheme is implemented in Riverbed Modeler (previously called as OPNET
                Modeler) network simulator and the performance is evaluated. The proposed scheme reduces the
                end-to-end packet delay and improves the performance of multimedia applications.</p>

         <h4> Project Title: “Delay Analysis of Mobile IP Protocol in Multimedia Applications” </h4>
         <p>  In this project, we peformed an extensive analysis of Mobile IP protocol using simulation in NS-2
                network simulator. The Mobile IP protocol is proposed to allow network layer mobility by allowing
                devices to handover among multiple networks without interrupting the ongoing connection. We
                evaluated the protocol in different scenarios and measure the performance in term of handover delay
                and packet loss. An inherited problem in Mobile IP protocol is “Triangular Routing” that dramatically
                increases the end-to-end delay is also investigated.</p>
